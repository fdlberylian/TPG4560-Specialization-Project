# TPG4560-Specialization-Project

The script uploaded here is developed to fulfill one of the objectives in my specialization project I took at NTNU in the Spring 2019 semester. The objective is to built a simple fully-implicit reservoir simulator using Python as a validation tool for more complex simulators. You can change simulation parameters in the script and test it out yourself.

Further details about how the script works are provided in the full Project Report [here](https://github.com/fdlberylian/TPG4560-Specialization-Project/blob/master/TPG4560_Report_Fadhil_Berylian_v2.0.pdf), specifically in Section 3.4 and Figure 3.4 within the report.
